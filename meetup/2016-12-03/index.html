If you&#x27;ve recently used React, React Native, Eslint or Yarn you might have noticed that they have an ultra fast and relevant searchbar to let you find your content easily.

They are using DocSearch, a entirely free product, that automatically crawl a documentation website every 24h, coupled with a tiny JS library to display results in a dropdown menu.

In this talk I will explain how DocSearch works internally, and how you can easily add it to your own documentation.</div><ul><li><a href="http://www.slidedeck.io/pixelastic/talk-docsearch">http://www.slidedeck.io/pixelastic/talk-docsearch</a></li></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul></div></li><li class="meetupContainer__item"><div class="Talk"><h3>Five minutes before prod</h3><div class="Talk_authors"><a href="https://twitter.com/xavedurand" class="Talk_author"><div class="Avatar Avatar--small"><img src="https://twitter.com/xavedurand/profile_image?size=bigger" class="Avatar__image"/></div><div>Xavier Durand</div></a></div><div class="Talk__description">This talk is about how we build &amp; deploy a complex AngularJS/TypeScript app in production at Aircall.

I will describe what happens between a git push production command and the release of it (Webpack build, tests &amp; AWS CodeDeploy).

I will release a new Aircall feature in live, during the talk.
As we use a continuous integration and delivery platform, the talk will be animated with the life cycle of a build.</div><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul></div></li><li class="meetupContainer__item"><div class="Talk"><h3>JavaScript, Unicode and the Emoji family</h3><div class="Talk_authors"><a href="https://twitter.com/stefanjudis" class="Talk_author"><div class="Avatar Avatar--small"><img src="https://twitter.com/stefanjudis/profile_image?size=bigger" class="Avatar__image"/></div><div>Stefan Judis</div></a></div><div class="Talk__description">In this quick lightning talk I want to go into into Unicode and have a look at Emojis specifically.
