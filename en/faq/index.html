<p><strong>You are!</strong> Paris.js is not affiliated with any company and doesn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúofficial‚Äù status. The community exists on its own and is managed by those who are interested in getting involved. As a community, it‚Äôs important for us to be <strong>free and independent</strong>.</p>
